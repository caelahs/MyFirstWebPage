    <b>Branch</b> 
Branches are like alternate timelines that we can save our commits to. If you visualize our current branch "master" as the trunk of a tree and all of our commits so far on master are like timestamps along the trunk.
<br></br>

<b>Clone </b> 
The clone() method makes a copy of selected elements, including child nodes, text and attributes.
<br></br>

<b>Commit</b> 
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.
<br></br>

<b>Fetch</b> 
Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.
<br></br>

<b>GIT</b>
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 
<br></br>

<b>Github</b>
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

<b>Merge</b>
A command that allows you to merge branches from Git. Merging is a common practice for developers. It takes the contents of a source branch and integrates it with a target branch.

<b>Conflict</b>
Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it.
<br></br>

git push updates the remote branch with local commits.
<br></br>

<b>Pull</b>
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
